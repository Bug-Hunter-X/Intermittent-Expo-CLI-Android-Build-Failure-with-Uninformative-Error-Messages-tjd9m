The exact solution depends on the root cause of the network issue.  Here are some potential workarounds:

1. **Improve Network Stability:** Ensure a stable internet connection with sufficient bandwidth during the build process. Avoid using unstable Wi-Fi networks or VPNs that may cause intermittent connectivity problems.
2. **Retry the Build:** If the build fails, try running `expo build:android` again. The issue may be transient and resolve itself on a subsequent attempt.
3. **Check Expo CLI Logs:** Carefully examine the Expo CLI logs for any additional clues that provide a more specific indication of the error. These logs often contain more information than the primary error message.
4. **Increase Timeout Values:** Some network requests during the build may time out. Explore ways to increase timeout settings within the Expo CLI configuration or the underlying networking libraries.
5. **Use a Build Machine with Reliable Internet:** Attempt building on a machine with a stable and reliable internet connection.

While this example doesn't offer a definitive fix, it highlights the problem and potential solutions to investigate further.
