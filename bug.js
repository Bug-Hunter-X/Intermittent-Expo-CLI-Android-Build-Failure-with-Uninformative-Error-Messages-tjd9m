This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message is vague and unhelpful, often stating something like "Build failed" without specifying the root cause.  The issue is intermittent and seemingly random, sometimes succeeding on subsequent attempts without code changes.  It seems linked to network connectivity issues during the build process, particularly when downloading dependencies or uploading the build to a cloud service. Debugging is difficult because the error messages aren't informative enough to pinpoint the problem. This example shows a basic React Native app setup using Expo.
